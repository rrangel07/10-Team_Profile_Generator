The purpose of this app is to create a responsive html containing cards with the information about the members of a software engineering team. Developing this app help me solidify knowledge on how to work with promises, create classes and subclasses.

## Installation

- Install Node.js in the computer.
- Then, clone the repository to the computer.
- After cloning the repository, run `npm install`, on the console, to get all the node modules. Make sure the console is in the correct directory before running the `npm install` command.

## Usage

1. On the console, go to the index.js directory

2. Run on the console the following command `node index.js`

3. The console is going to start prompting different questions about the team's manager.

4. Once you finish answering all the questions about the manager, the app will ask if you want to:

  - Add a new team member (Engineer or Intern)
  - Exit (Generate the team)

5. If 'Engineer' or 'Intern' is selected, it is going to prompt questions about that team member and, after the questions, it is going to give the option to add another member or exit.
